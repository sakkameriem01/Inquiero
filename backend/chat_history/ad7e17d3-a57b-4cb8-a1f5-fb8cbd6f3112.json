However, it's important to note that the Tenant may be liable for costs towards damages caused by negligence (Source 2) and any dues (if any) at the time of refunding the security deposit (Source 2). Also, the Tenant is responsible for day-to-day minor repairs at his/her own expense (Source 4), and failure to comply with this could potentially lead to issues. The Rent Agreement can be terminated by either party after serving one month's notice in writing (Source 1). If the Tenant breaches any terms of the agreement, such as subletting or assigning the premises, the Owner may have grounds for legal action (Source 4), although no specific penalties are mentioned.",
